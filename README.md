# House-price-estimation-from-visual-and-textual-features

I have been using the House Prices dataset from Ahmed and Moustafaâ€™s 2016 paper
This dataset includes both numerical/categorical data along with images data for each of the 535 example houses in the dataset.
## The numerical and categorical attributes include:
1.Number of bedrooms \n
2.Number of bathrooms
3.Area (i.e., square footage)
4.Zip code

## A total of four images are provided for each house as well:
1.Bedroom
2.Bathroom
3.Kitchen
4.Frontal view of the house
