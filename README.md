# House-price-estimation-from-visual-and-textual-features

I have been using the House Prices dataset from Ahmed and Moustafaâ€™s 2016 paper
This dataset includes both numerical/categorical data along with images data for each of the 535 example houses in the dataset.
## The numerical and categorical attributes include:
* 1.Number of bedrooms
* 2.Number of bathrooms
* 3.Area (i.e., square footage)
* 4.Zip code

## A total of four images are provided for each house as well:
* 1.Bedroom
* 2.Bathroom
* 3.Kitchen
* 4.Frontal view of the house

# Here we are going to work with multiple inputs and mixed data with Keras.
