# House-price-estimation-from-visual-and-textual-features

I have been using the House Prices dataset from Ahmed and Moustafaâ€™s 2016 paper
* You can find the dataset here https://github.com/emanhamed/Houses-dataset
* This dataset includes both numerical/categorical data along with images data for each of the 535 example houses in the dataset.
## The numerical and categorical attributes include:
* Number of bedrooms
* Number of bathrooms
* Area (i.e., square footage)
* Zip code

## A total of four images are provided for each house as well:
* Bedroom
* Bathroom
* Kitchen
* Frontal view of the house

Here we are going to work with multiple inputs and mixed data with Keras.
